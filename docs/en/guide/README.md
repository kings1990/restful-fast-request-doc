[**Restful Fast Request**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/16988-fast-request) is a plugin based on springmvc that
help you quickly generate **url** and **params**.It is also a http client tool.
You only need to click the rocket icon on the left side of the method, the plugin will help you generate the method url
and parameters and display in the tool window, and then click Send Request to complete the API debugging in IDEA, and
you can save the history request


Compared with the HTTP Client, Restful Fast Request not only has the built-in functions of the HTTP Client, but also
provides a friendly, easy-to-understand and intuitive interface, which makes it more convenient and simple for users to
debug the API. At the same time, various types of parameters also provide different customization methods to make it
more flexible.

::: tip PURPOSE  
The purpose of the plug-in is to simplify development and improve efficiency. Our vision is to become the best partner of IDEA, just like Contra's 1P, 2P, base-friend collocation, and double the efficiency.
